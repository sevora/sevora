<h2>Projects I Made 🏆</h2>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/sevora/ramble">Ramble 📱</a></h3>
<div>Ramble is a fullstack social media application structured in a simple, manageable, and extendable style. I made this primarily for a university project in our Computer Science Course and the goal is to be able to write a CRUD-application utilizing a SQL database management system. This is welcome to improvements and updates! Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/MHW0uYfY7Ho?si=w_kjMSEK58OMyYNX">this YouTube video</a> where I showcase ramble. This project was written with Node.js, TypeScript, React, Dart, and Flutter.</div>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/sevora/stmviz">STMVIZ 💍</a></h3>
<div>Stable-Marriage Algorithm Visualizer written for AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest of Summer-Fall 2020. Try it out <a href="https://sevora.github.io/stmviz/">here</a>. You can also watch the 1-min trailer on <a href="https://youtu.be/yxNn02h3MzI">YouTube</a>. This was developed with JavaScript.</div>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/sevora/TodoPlusGPT">TodoPlusGPT ✒️</a></h3>
<div>This is a well-designed calendar and todo-list application that has integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The gimmick here is that it allows you to set your goals and it will be able to generate the tasks needed across days in order for you to accomplish the set goal. This was developed on React Native.</div>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/sevora/regex-to-fa">Regex To Finite Automaton 🤖</a></h3>
<div>This application generates a finite automaton diagram as you input a regular expression. The core algorithm used is Thompson Construction in order to construct the diagram from a set of patterns. This rendering is done using the native HTML5 Canvas API on the web and CustomPainter on Flutter.</div>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator">Simple Calculator 🔢</a></h3>
<div>Knowing how to code is one thing, structuring a project is another. I made this desktop application with Java as a way to test out my skills and learn more about organizing code and making something that's easy to modify and maintain. Download it  <a href="https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator/releases/tag/v2.0.0">here</a>. This was written with Java 11 + Maven and JavaFX.</div>

<h2>Need Something Done 🤔</h2>
<div>I'm open to requests and we can discuss the project you would like done. You could reach out to me via <a href="mailto:ralph.louis.g@gmail.com">email</a>.
