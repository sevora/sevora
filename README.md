Stable-Marriage Algorithm Visualizer developed for AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest of Summer-Fall 2020. Try it out [here](https://sevora.github.io/stmviz/). You can also watch the 1-minute trailer on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/yxNn02h3MzI). Developed with vanilla JavaScript and no frameworks.

### [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator)
![](./assets/banners/simple-calculator.jpg)
Knowing how to code is one thing, structuring a project is another. I made this desktop application with Java as a way to test out my skills and learn more about organizing code and making something that's easy to modify and maintain. Download it [here](https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This was developed with Java 11 + Maven and JavaFX.

Need a Collaborator
