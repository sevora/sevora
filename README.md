<h2>Projects I Made 🏆</h2>
<h3>STMVIZ 💍</h3>
<div>Stable-Marriage Algorithm Visualizer written for AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest of Summer-Fall 2020. Try it out <a href="https://sevora.github.io/stmviz/">here</a>. You can also watch the 1-min trailer on <a href="https://youtu.be/yxNn02h3MzI">YouTube</a>.</div>

<h3>Artgrid 🎨</h3>
<div>A set of python scripts that allows one to make a certain kind of collage. It generates a large image that when zoomed in is made up of smaller distinct images. An example would be an image of an arcade machine but when you zoom in on it you see different classic video-game related images. It's not the most optimized version but it works.</div>

<h3>Gamebreaker 🎮</h3>
<div>A collection of interactive pages and scripts with algorithms to solve different classic games. It's a great way to learn more about mathematics, game theory, and other computer science concepts. Check it out <a href="https://sevora.github.io/gamebreaker">here</a>. Currently stale, but I hope to at least add 10-20 more games.</div>

<h3>Simple Calculator 🔢</h3>
<div>Knowing how to code is one thing, structuring a project is another. I made this desktop application with Java as a way to test out my skills and learn more about organizing code and making something that's easy to modify and maintain. Download it  <a href="https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator/releases/tag/v2.0.0">here</a>. Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator">here</a>.</div>

<h3>Cell Theory Timeline 🔬</h3>
<div>I made this because I didn't want to use a powerpoint for my high school presentation. I felt that powerpoints were overused and boring. To navigate in this website, scroll up or down. See it <a href="https://sevora.github.io/cell-theory-timeline/index.html">here</a>.</div>

<h3>Deebait.space 🗣️</h3>
<div>This is an anonymous one-to-one debate website where people can choose between opinions and get matched with someone of a different opinion than them. This is more of a practice working on fullstack. Check out the source code <a href="https://github.com/sevora/deebait">here</a>. It was hosted before but no one's using it anyways and I haven't updated the topics as well.</div>

<h3>Fairu 🎓</h3>
<div>This is built similar to Deebait. I wanted to make a file archiving website mainly for materials related to school or education. It didn't take off but the source code is <a href="https://github.com/sevora/fairu">here</a>.</div>

<h3>AspirePH 🩺</h3>
<div>This project was done in collaboration with an amazing team from De La Salle University. It estimates the risks of getting the virus through a simple and easy test. See source code <a href="https://github.com/sevora/covid-risk-estimator">here</a>. It was hosted before but due to lack of support it isn't anymore.<div>

<h2>Need Something Done 🤔</h2>
<div>I'm open to requests and we can discuss the project you would like done. You could reach out to me via <a href="mailto:business.ralph.louis.gopez@gmail.com">email</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/ralphlouisgopez" target="blank_">Twitter</a> or commission me on <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/ralphlouisgopez" target="_blank">Fiverr</a>.</div>

<h2>Awesome Art by TenaceTracks</h2>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/TenaceTracks">@TenaceTracks</a> is a friend of mine and he makes pretty amazing digital art.</div>
