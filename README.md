<img src="./assets/banners/simple-calculator.jpg" alt="simple-calculator" width="600" />

Knowing how to code is one thing, structuring a project is another. I made this desktop application with Java as a way to test out my skills and learn more about organizing code and making something that's easy to modify and maintain. Download it [here](https://github.com/sevora/simple-calculator/releases/tag/v2.0.0). This was developed with Java 11 + Maven and JavaFX.
