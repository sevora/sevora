<h2>Projects I Made 🏆</h2>'
<h3>STMVIZ 💍</h3>
<div>Stable-Marriage Algorithm Visualizer written for AlgoExpert SWE Project Contest of Summer-Fall 2020. Try it out <a href="https://sevora.github.io/stmviz/">here</a>. You can also watch the 1-min trailer on <a href="https://youtu.be/yxNn02h3MzI">YouTube</a>.</div>

<h3>Deebait.space 🗣️</h3>
<div>This is an anonymous one-to-one debate website where people can choose between opinions and get matched with someone of a different opinion than them. This is more of a practice working on fullstack.</div>

<h3>Fairu 🎓</h3>
<div>This is built similar to Deebait.space. I wanted to make a file archiving website mainly for materials related to school or education. It didn't take off but the source code is <a href="https://github.com/sevora/fairu">here</a>.</div>

<h3>Artgrid 🎨</h3>
<div>A set of python scripts that allows one to make a large image that when zoomed in is made up of smaller distinct images. It's not the most optimized version but it works.</div>

<h3>Gamebreaker 🎮</h3>
<div>A collection of interactive pages and scripts with algorithms to solve different classic games. It's a great way to learn more about mathematics, game theory, and other computer science concepts. Check it out <a href="https://sevora.github.io/gamebreaker">here</a>. Currently stale, but I hope to at least add at least 10-20 more game.</div>

<h3>Cell Theory Timeline 🔬</h3>
<div>I made this because I didn't want to use a powerpoint for my high school presentation. Scroll up or down to move to the next part. See it <a href="https://sevora.github.io/cell-theory-timeline/index.html">here</a>.</div>

<h3>AspirePH 🩺</h3>
<div>This is not my work exactly. This project was done in collaboration with an amazing team from De La Salle University. It estimates the risks of getting the virus through a simple and easy test. See source code <a href="https://github.com/sevora/covid-risk-estimator">here</a>. It was hosted before but due to lack of support it isn't anymore.<div>
<h2>Awesome Art by TenaceTracks</h2>
<div><a href="https://twitter.com/TenaceTracks">@TenaceTracks</a> is a friend of mine and he makes pretty amazing digital art.</div>
